My name is Omar Martinez. I have 12 years of professional experience in web development, UI and UX and Project Management. I started my career in a digital advertising agency in South Florida. With the agency, I had the opportunity to work with the following clients: Bacardi, Howard Stern, Island Def Jam, Nintendo and Air Force to name a few. I'm currently in the pursuit in a Product Management role.

I currently live in Seattle, WA. I was born and raised in Puerto Rico. Moved to South Florida in the early 2000's and lived there for 14 years.

I'm passionate about the internet, technology, interactive experiences and music. The blog will talk about work, health and what I'm passionate about. If you find any facts that I mention wrong, or have any other suggestions, please feel free to edit the post.
