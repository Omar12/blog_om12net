I'm Omar Martinez. I'm a Front-End Developer with 12 years of professional experience. I have been a designer, a project manager and even a video and audio editor. Front-End Development has been the role that has anchored my
career. For the past 2 years, I have focused on working more with JavaScript.

I'm passionate about digital, from a spectators point of view. This blog is
a collection from my Point of View. I will share my thoughts and feelings
about various topics. I will be sharing what I learned with the hope that you will learn something new as well.
