<h3>Publish Platforms</h3>
<p>AskOmar.com started as an inside joke within friends, when in conversations, I would know a little bit of everything and drop knowledge about any subject, a friend of mine called Patricia suggested that I should have a AskOmar website that people would submit questions. The idea was hilarious, so I bought the domain and the first version of it was a question field that would send me an email.. I only got 2 questions... from Patricia. After the slight failure, I evolved into a blog. After a few posts and lack of consistency in posting, I started uploading my mixes and using AskOmar to publish them:</p>
<p><a href="http://askomar.com" target="_blank">AskOmar.com</a></p>
<h4>Tumblr:</h4>
<p>Tumblogs are quick and easy to get them running. I usually get a topic in mind to talk about and create a Tumblr blog about it.</p>
