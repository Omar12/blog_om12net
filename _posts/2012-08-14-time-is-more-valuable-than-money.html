<blockquote>"Time is more Valuable than Money, Because You Can't Get It Back."</p></blockquote>
<p>I'm asking for a small bit of your time, I promise it won't be much. We value money, because it is tangible. The more we have, the more we can put in a bank account and spend. But what about time? What about this precise moment... it just went away. You just this precise second and you are not getting it back.</p>
<p>We all have a set of time, it can be decades, years, months, days, hours, minutes or seconds. We really don't know how much time exactly we have. The worth of time is usually the opposite of money, the less time we have, the more we value it. We need to live every moment like it's worthÂ immensely.</p>
<p>Spend your time in what is worth. It can be in your family or your friends. In an activity that brings you joy or happiness. It can be traveling to new places and meeting new people. Work is usually the activity that you will consume a lot of your time, make sure you are passionate and love what you do, in what you work. I cannot tell you, in what specifically you should spend your time, you will have to determine that, follow your instinct and make sure you get the most out of your time.</p>
<p>The return investment of time is experiences. We are born in dust, we die in dust. We cannot take our money with us to our grave, but we can take a soul full of experiences and joy when we bring experiences from a time well spent.</p>
