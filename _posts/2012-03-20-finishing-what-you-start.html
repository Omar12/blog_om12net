<p>Finishing what you start seems simpler said than done. At least for me. Having at least 15 drafts, struggling to finish personal projects and almost completing the assembly of a 3D Printer have been a few of my unfinished businesses.</p>
<p>This is something that I would normally not share, but I feel that I'm not the only one that suffers from this lost of momentum to put the finishing touches to a piece of work.</p>
<p>If you take into perspective, you have done all the hard stuff. You have built it in a strong foundation, your core idea is there, almost everything is in place, except those little details. Those 5 pixels of padding missing, the smoothness of two graphics, the skipped frames that JavaScript ignored, the timing belt that unexpectedly stretched and your X-axis doesn't move properly.</p>
<p>All those things are minor things, if you see them as big tasks, you will never get done. Make a to-do of all the small things that still need should be completed and your main goal is to check all your list off.</p>
<p>Sure, I will look back into this post and I may think of adding more lines of insight... or I may not, but I wanted to feel accomplished and not stack one more Draft post.</p>
