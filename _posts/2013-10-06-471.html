<p>This object can do everything that you can imagine. It can browse the Internet, take great photographs and panoramas, record video and audio, you can check your email or what your friends are saying on their favorite social networks. This device can do everything! Ah, and also can make phone calls. The <em>Smart</em> <strong>Phone</strong>!</p>
<p>The reason we call it a phone it’s because it’s the only way to market without bewildering consumers. Calling it a phone or smart phone is misleading and outdated. It is the time to find a better name for the device, a name that is more accurate and especially marketable.</p>
<p>The name that I propose is the <strong>PocketBook</strong>.</p>
