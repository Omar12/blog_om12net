<p>Turn on your screen reader, let go of your mouse and take the time to go through the your web project and see if you can experience fully your website.</p>
<p>It's common for us as web developers to have accessibility as an oversight because we can still experience our applications normally. Most of us take into consideration heading order, alt attribute in images and maybe even aria roles.</p>
<p>Context is key. Having links that just say "click here" is not enough. Icons are visually appealing but if they don't have context, either by visual text or hidden content for screens, they don't fulfill their purpose.</p>
<p>Of course there is more to thr picture, but considering your work to be accessible to those with disabilities is a start.&nbsp;</p>
