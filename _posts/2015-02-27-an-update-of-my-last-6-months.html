<p>I had an eventful 2014. A year of learning, self discovery and big changes.</p>
<p>I ended my tenure at AgencyTEN. Most of my&nbsp;career growth happened here.&nbsp;I had&nbsp;the opportunity to work on&nbsp;great projects with great individuals. I met many great people there that I'm happy to call them friends.</p>
<p>After my departure, I explored the world of freelancing. It was a satisfying experience. I wore many hats, worked on quick turn around projects and continued growing professionally.</p>
<p>Earlier 2014, I joined FromSomebodyElse with&nbsp;Bryant and Justen&nbsp;(two ex-colleagues from AgencyNet). It was a fun and enlightening experience working with them. I took an example of their work ethic that&nbsp;motivated me to do my best. I loved the work I did with them&nbsp;working&nbsp;with them. My favorite work produced with them is the site for <a href="http://www.balloonagency.com">Balloon Agency</a>.</p>
<p>I started applying for jobs Worldwide. From Thailand to Netherlands, the World was the limit at to where I would work next. My first stop was Austin, TX.</p>
<p>Austin was a great chapter. My goal in Austin was to move and find a new full-time job. I went to job interviews, met smart individuals and had a great time in such fun city.</p>
<p>I had the space and time to self-reflect and have a better picture of what should be next for me.</p>
<p>I had the opportunity to interview for a position at Amazon. The interview process was a one of a kind for me, to say the least. I came prepared, but not prepared enough. I had the opportunity to talk about my work&nbsp;to&nbsp;a group of smart individuals that had the right questions.</p>
<p>I determined that Seattle was the place to start a new life. There was not a job in place, but we decided that it was best for us. We drove across the United States.</p>
<p>Our trip started in West Palm Beach. Our first stop was New Orleans. We stayed at a haunted hostel, we enjoyed local food and got a good vibe of NOLA. Our next stop was Austin, TX. We stayed there for 5 days, enjoyed the Texas BBQ and the great city that is Austin. Along our journey, we went through various national parks, each withs unique beauty.</p>
<p>Our next stop was Taos New Mexico. We visited the Native American town of Taos, a rather unique and beautiful place. Our next stop was the Grand Canyon in Arizona. We did a 5-hour hike down to Canyon. At night&nbsp;we enjoyed the breathtaking view of the skies&nbsp;Milky Way. Next we visited Las Vegas Nevada and stopped by the Hoover Dam along the way. We walked the Vegas strip, gambled&nbsp;and got front row seats for Cirque Du Soleil "O".</p>
<p>Our road out from Las Vegas to California, we took the Death Valley road. We made it to the Sequoia Forest. We made a stop at some friends home in Fresno. Our next destination was San Francisco and Sacramento. After Sacramento, we made a straight shot to our destination.</p>
<p>Along our trip, I got a job offer to work at [redacted]. I've been putting my skills into practice and continue to grow professionally.</p>
<p>Seattle is a beautiful city, we are happy to be here. The vibe here is great, we don't mind the rain but I mind the lower temperatures. We enjoy&nbsp;our hikes, the restaurants and just the vibe of the city. I make Pike Place Market part of my commute. We are setting roots in Seattle and we look for a prosper future here.</p>
