Jumping to write JavaScript could be met with minor obstacles. The obstacles are created from trying to establish a solid foundation for your JavaScript project.

The following are some of my personal tips to help streamline your development process. Keep in mind that they are guidelines, not laws; they will have exceptions and you should follow what works best for you.

## Keep things simple
Avoid until is necessary, the use of libraries. Scale your tools at the same pace that your project is scaling.

## Have a project boilerplate that works for you...
Live and die by DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself). Create a project boilerplate with the build tools that fit your style of coding. Make a commitment in what you feel comfortable working. You want to get right into developing your application.

## ... or use Codepen or JSBin
Supporting my first point of keeping things simple, [Codepen](http://codepen.io) or [JSBin](http:jsbin.com) will assist you with that. You can work up on your project starts having many moving parts.

## Create a tool belt of utility libraries
Utility libraries like [lodash](https://lodash.com/), [underscore](http://underscorejs.org/), [moment](http://momentjs.com/) or [VerbalExpressions](https://github.com/VerbalExpressions/JSVerbalExpressions), are great to consider to have part right from the start. I love the libraries mentioned and alike due to how simple they are to use immediately in your project. This contradicts my first point, make sure you take the time to explore them and incorporate them in your tool belt.

## Save code snippets
If you are like me, you search through your code for that piece of code that you found on Stack Overflow that proved to be useful. When you find pieces of reusable code in your application, save them into a snippet collection.

I use [Dash](https://kapeli.com/dash), but [gist](https://gist.github.com) is as good (and free). You can even save and insert your gist snippets using the [gist Atom package](https://atom.io/packages/gist).
