<p>Remember when you were a kid and saw futuristic movies and feeling that the things the movies portrayed were so far away? It still feels that way but yesterday, with Apple announcing the <strong>New MacBook Pro with <em>Retina Display</em></strong>, my mind was literally blown away.</p>
<p>You have to understand what Apple did with this machine. Nothing in this machine is legacy technology. It doesn't have <strong>USB 2</strong>, it doesn't have an <strong>Ethernet port</strong>, it doesn't have a <strong>Optical Drive</strong>, it doesn't have a <strong>1440x900</strong> resolution; it has technology that is ahead of its time.</p>
<p>Let's have a look at the specs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Retina display: 15.4-inch, 2880-by-1800 resolution at 220 pixels per inch</li>
<li>8GB of 1600MHz DDR3L of RAM</li>
<li>Flash storage (Solid State)</li>
<li>Two Thunderbolt ports (up to 10 Gbps)</li>
<li>Two USB 3 ports (up to 5 Gbps)</li>
<li>HDMI port</li>
<li>SDXC card slot</li>
<li>Bluetooth 4.0</li>
</ul>
<p>Look at the technologies listed above, there are barely no compatible devices for them! They are forcing vendors to accelerate their product cycles by <strong>YEARS</strong>.</p>
<p>Apple is taking a big chance and they are not taking prisoners. Apple is not afraid to  take chances with new technology. They have done it with the Phone and the Pads, now they are doing again with Laptops.</p>
<p>The hardware is half the story, with each new release of their Operating Systems, coming soon is Mountain Lion; they are gradually unifying all devices into a single experience. The next version of the MacBook Pro or possibly the MacBook Air, it will have touch screens. Their operating system is already training users to get used to iOS User Behaviors, or Natural User Interfaces.</p>
<p>In the near future, Apple products will focus on household products that you will be able to control with your other iDevices. Either if you love or hate Apple, you have to admire what they are doing with the push of technology. Other ones will mimic and we will follow, it will be our <em>unified lifestyle</em>.</p>
