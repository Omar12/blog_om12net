<p>The modern person, spends most of their day in front of a screen, most probably hunching towards the screen. When we start with this behavior, we don’t feel any negative so we tend not to change it until we start experiencing aches or if someone else points it out.</p>
<p>Having a good posture is good for you. There is nothing negative about good posture, it makes you look better, your clothes fits better, it makes you feel better and improves your well being.</p>
<p>The following are some quick tips for you to improve on your posture:</p>
<p><strong>Exercise</strong> - While I’m trying to focus on quick tips, an essential advice is to have a proper exercise routine. You want your body to be active and healthy.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/09/the-scientific-7-minute-workout/">7 Minute Workout</a></strong> - If you have a busy day, I recommend this exercise routine. Like it says, it just takes 7 seven minutes of your day. It is recommended to be a high intensity workout for full effects. My personal advice after doing it for many months now, is to do it at your own pace, and increase the intensity the more you do it. There are many <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/7-minute-workout/id650762525?mt=8">apps</a> and <a href="http://7min.io/">websites</a> that will help you keep track of the time and the exercise that you need to be performing.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise to improve posture</strong> - The following video explains a quick and simple exercise that you do twice a day. After a month of doing the exercise, you should start seeing improvement in your posture.</p>

<p><strong>Thoracic Bridge stretch</strong> - This is a stretch that just takes 30 seconds to do. It stretches your back and hips.</p>

<p><strong>Sit down at a 135º angle</strong> - Proper posture for long periods of time is at a 135º angle. This is leaning back and giving the impression that you are slacking off. Most chairs recline to this angle.</p>
<p><strong>Walk every 20 minutes</strong> - This can be a hard one to do, because we need long periods of focus through out the day. You should try and walk, this improves your blood circulation, your digestive system and doesn’t give your body the opportunity to say that is ok to be sitting down for long periods of time.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.intelliskin.net/">Intelliskin</a></strong> - The Intelliskin is an undershirt that you wear during the day. They can be a bit expensive but it’s worth it. I’ve been using it for the past 2 months and I immediately felt positive results. It can be painful at the beginning, which what is happening is that is making your muscles be at the correct posture and aligning or reprogramming them to be at the correct posture.</p>
<p>There are other many great tips and advices that you can do to improve your posture and reduce aches because of bad posture. I encourage you to find what works for you or if you have any tips that you would like to share, please do so.</p>
