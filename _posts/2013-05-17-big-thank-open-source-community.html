<p>We take for granted the Open Source community, we forget how great it has been to every developer, from the teenager putting their website together while learning, to the seasoned developer. The Open Source Community has helped many people to learn and launch their products.</p>
<p>I want to say Thank You. This is a Thank You to the whole community, to everyone that participates in Open Source projects. Thank you for not being shy and letting everyone see and critique your code. Thank you for having the mindset of contributing. Thank you for not forcing a fee to use the work that you spent nights writing. Todayâ€™s best products started from an Open Source project and they still use some Open Source components. Thanks to Open Source the state of web technologies are as advanced as it is today.</p>
