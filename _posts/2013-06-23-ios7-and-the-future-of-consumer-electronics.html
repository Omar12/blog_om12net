<p>Apple revamped the look and feel of their next iOS. At first instance, we all felt disgusted of how bad and “half-ass” the interface looks; "there was no attention to detail", "they are doing flat design to just be hip". All these feelings were expressed as this was a cold bucket of water to the head to every Apple consumer that were accustomed to the current iOS design. The is a drastic change barely no legacy design being rolled over to this new style, Apple is moving away from their skeuomorphic designs and adopting Flat Design. Whether is popular, loved or not, Apple made a conscious and well-thought decision to move into this direction.</p>
<p>It's hard to understand their rationale at this moment but letting the design and thought sink in I can see that this is a well calculated step forward by Apple. For the first time, the new design direction ties their hardware design with their software design. This is when Sir Jon Ivey <a href="http://www.wired.com/opinion/2013/06/the-future-of-design-is-more-than-making-apple-ios-flat/">contribution</a> comes in.</p>
<p>Apple is thinking bigger with iOS, I can foresee that their roadmap won't be solely staying within the phone and mobile realm, they are aiming to expand to outside the small screen, they are designing their software to connect with the rest of the consumer electronics.</p>
<p>Reaching consumer electronics is where flat design comes in. Creating a rather generic looking UI, Apple is facilitating the unification of non Apple hardware. It's crucial when we see Apple powering the dashboard of cars, later we will see the powering of companion hardware and in the near future powering the most important aspect: Smart Houses.</p>
<p>Smart Houses is the future of our living. Soon, everyone will be able to control every single aspect of their household from the comfort of their phone, anywhere in the World the homeowner is. This phase is already happening, we have seen this become a reality with project like <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/smartthings/smartthings-make-your-world-smarter">SmartThings</a>. The talk on the topic has <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2013/05/internet-of-things/all/">increased</a>, and I believe Apple knows this is the future of consumer electronics, the next tech revolution. The power of their design is in the context that it will be used. They are optimistic that this is the future that we will live and they setting the foundation for it.</p>
