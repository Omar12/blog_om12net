In an collaborative work environment, relaying critique and criticism is part of the day to day operations. Proper critique can translate to the success of a specific goal or task. Work environments embed the habit of criticism in the form of peer reviews. Peer reviews can be Code Reviews, Pull Requests, Design Feedback, Editor reviews, yearly reviews and other forms. The end goal for all of them is the same, that the end product achieves its goals at the highest quality possible.

Even when criticism is part of a day-to-day exercise, some of us are not adept at giving proper criticism. There can be many reasons, it can be a personality trait, lack of exposure in working with constructive teams, or lack of guidance on how to communicate criticism. Bad criticism has the potential to break a person or team, they won't improve and they may continue to make the same mistakes. The same weight of responsibility goes to receiving criticism, if we don't know how to receive and action on criticism, we may continue to do the same mistakes. The following is a baseline on how to relay and receive criticism, take it and adapt to your style and personality.

### Receiving Criticism
Let's say you work long hours, you successfully moved forward on the task that got your stumped for half a day, you feel great that you finished the task that you worked so hard on. It can be a programming bug, a new feature, an article or design. Your work is ready to be reviewed by your peers, you are excited or nervous to share your finished work. The feedback you may get could be that "it needs improvement", "it doesn't align with the goal" or "this sucks!". My first advise is to **not take it personal**.

Don't take it personal. It's easy to fall into the frame of thought that is a personal attack on your work and capacity. Shit, you "got it done", "it works", "I explored all options", "it's the best you can do". A side note, _the work you can be the best to date, but not the best that you will ever do_. With that, be receptive to the criticism that you receive. The comments from your peers may sting, it may question your ability, especially if you start comparing to your peers. Remember that you and your colleagues are part of your team, all of you are working on the goal of delivering high quality work. See their criticism as support of an oversight or weakness of your part.

Being part of a team, work with your teammates. Follow up with more questions, "where does it fall short?", "what can I do to get closer to the goal?", "what you have done differently?", "are there is support material to improve on topic x?". The questions will vary on the situation, but the frame of thought of **follow-up** and **collaboration** stays, it will help you improve at the task that you are being critiqued.

In summary: don't take it personal, be receptive, you are part of a team that want to deliver high quality work, follow up with your peers and collaborate.


### Giving Criticism
If you are giving criticism on the day to day basis, it's very likely you have the experience in the field that you are reviewing. You are in the current position because you have proven to be an expert in an area and have an understanding of what the end goal is. You are comfortable at criticism, because you have received your fair share of it. My most important advice to provide criticism is to not be an asshole. For most cases, this may be a personality trait or simply a lack of awareness, but it can be as well frustration that the criticism that you have given in the past has been ignored. Don't make it personal.

For you to give valuable criticism, try to remember from individuals in the past that provided criticism that made a positive impact on you. The impact made on you can be how they influenced on your approach, or the way they phrased the feedback or helped you to consistently deliver on your goals. Use that positive impact, as a checklist for yourself to give criticism; pay forward the lessons that made you better that will make others better.

If you have received negative or toxic feedback, remind yourself of the outcome of that feedback and how you felt. Don't make others feel bad, in most cases nothing good comes out of it, remember that you and you are a team.

#### Don’t use Like or Dislike
This is an exercise that I learned at school. At a Design Finals project, the professor gave us instructions to critique everyones work. The only constraint is to not use "like" or dislike". This is an exercise to enforce constructive criticism. It immediately makes criticism not a personal attack. An example feedback of this approach can be the following:

> "I see how this area works, it's something that I would have done. On this other area it has room for improvement. Although it works, it doesn't align with the goal that we are trying to achieve. I would consider exploring X, Y and Z. This is what has been done in the past that has worked. If you have any questions or need other examples, please let me know."

That's a more adequate feedback, better than "that shit sucks, wtf were you thinking?". The goal is to be constructive and analytical with your critique. Using “like” and “dislike” can be attached to core emotions and easily perceived as a personal attack.

#### Be a mentor
Strive to make a lasting impression on the person you are critiquing. If you lead by example, your team will follow and they will help others. This is an environment that can be successful for everyone. Your influence have no boundaries. Pursue a work environment that people want to work with you. Be open to conversation with superiors and those under you, remember that you can learn from everyone that you are willing to be open-minded and constructive with.

In summary, don't be an asshole, follow the example of those who made a positive impact on you, don't use the word like or dislike, be a mentor and don't be an asshole.

Remember, positive criticism can go far along. It can help reach faster the goals you're working on, stay on track, make a positive impact on individuals and make you a better person.
