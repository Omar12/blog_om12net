<p>This may well be a series, in its own category but for now let’s see how this works.</p>
<p>To come up with an idea for an app or tool, you first need to have a problem in order to create a tool to deal with it. A lot of the apps in mind, I don’t have the capacity or resources to do myself. With that said, I have a free App idea for anyone that wants to take up the challenge:</p>
<p><strong>Quick App Toolbar Launcher</strong>: The idea is simple, have the app run on your toolbar. This toolbar app will provide you with a list of active projects that you are working on. You assign the following parameters and what each parameter will do:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Project Name</strong> - This will be for reference of the user to know what to open. </li>
<li><strong>Project ‘project’ file</strong> - This will be the project file for the text editor or IDE of choice. This will be used to open the corresponding software. </li>
<li><strong>Filepath</strong> - This will open the folder in Finder. </li>
<li><strong>Extra commands or apps</strong> - This can be to open Terminal and run a user defined command or apps like CodeKit. That’s all what the app is, an utility to quickly launch a user specified list of projects. If this already exists, please point me to it! I will give them my money!</li>
</ul>
