<p>A young mind is eager to try new experiences. A young mind doesnâ€™t worry about tomorrow. A young mind is not afraid of failure. Old minds gain experience, knowledge and doubt. Old minds question every step on the way, worrying that something may go wrong. Old minds like to play it safe, young minds take risks.</p>
<p>We need to be young at minds with the old in it. Life is only one and you need to believe in the experience that your mind has acquired.</p>
