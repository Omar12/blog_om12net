Welcome to the relaunch of my blog. Now you can find all my posts in one place. I've moved away from the free Wordpress.com blog to a S3 hosted [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) blog. I'm using the AMP-optimized [Amplify](https://github.com/ageitgey/amplify) theme.

The reason I decided to move to Jekyll is that I wanted the following:

- A better theme
- No ads
- Add a "Edit Page" button.

The last one is the most important reason. I believe in Open Source and everyone that wants to add any contribution. I have written and will write technical posts. Some of my terminology or techniques will be incorrect. I want to give the reader the ability to fix my mistakes. Of course, I will give the proper credit.

Using the [Amplify](https://github.com/ageitgey/amplify) theme, I learned about Google's [Accelerated Mobile Pages Project](https://www.ampproject.org/) or AMP. The goal for AMP is for web pages to load very fast on mobile devices ⚡️!
