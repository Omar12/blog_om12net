Welcome to the relaunch of my blog. Now you can find all my posts in one place. I've moved away from the free Wordpress.com blog to a S3 hosted Jekyll blog. I'm using the AMP-optimized Amplify theme.

The reason I decided to move to Jekyll is that I wanted the following:
- A better theme
- No ads
- Add a "Edit Page" button.

The last one is the most important reason. I believe in Open Source and everyone that wants to add any contribution. I have written and will write technical posts. Some of my terminology or techniques will be incorrect. I want to give the reader the ability to fix my mistakes. Of course, I will give the proper credit.
