<p>When there a thought is good enough, but too long for a Tweet, I write it down in my Day One private journal. This Journal is to share the thoughts worth sharing. They are intended to spark a comprehensive dialog.</p>
<p>Donâ€™t expect a polished writing or a thousand word entry. Expect pure raw material, emotional and hopefully thought provoking. Enjoy my journal.</p>
