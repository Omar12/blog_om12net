<p>Most probably you haven’t heard of Black Mirror unless you live in the U.K. or haven’t found discussions of the show online. Black Mirror is a show created by Charlie Brooker. The show focuses on the dark side of technology and social media.</p>
<p>They address the power of the public opinion on social media, the way gamingfication changes your moral ground, or what can be done when you overshare online. It also gives you their vision of the future in some of the episodes.</p>
<p>The Season 1 Finale gives you the story of possible future iterations of the Google Glass.</p>
<p>The plot of every episode will stick on your head for days, you will see on first hand some of the subplots on first hand.</p>
<p>I highly recommend this show when it’s available on U.S. television.</p>
